Hello! Thanks for checking out this project!

My code and project write-up are located within the repository.

When analyzing the dynamics of a European call option, many models can be applied to help calculate the option’s price; especially, in situations where interest rate volatility is not static. In this analysis, the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model is used to assess the interest rate of a European call option. Over both a 12-month and 52-week period, this analysis will show how the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model, as well as the asset pricing model derived from Ito’s Lemma, and the pay-off framework for a European option, relate between the time intervals in question. Later, this framework will be compared to a calculation of the option's price using geometric Brownian motion.
