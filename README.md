When analyzing the dynamics of a European call option, many models can be applied to help calculate the option’s price; especially, in situations where interest rate volatility is not static. In this analysis, the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model is used to assess the interest rate of a European call option. Over both a 12-month and 52-week period, this analysis will show how the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model, as well as the asset pricing model derived from Ito’s Lemma, and the pay-off framework for a European option, relates between the time intervals. In addition, this framework is similar to models where the interest rate is fixed, and the European call option is calculated using geometric Brownian motion.
